# TFSliderView
TFSliderView is an easy to use stylish toggle switch for iOS 8+ built on the POP animation framework. I put it together for use in an inhouse project and thought I'd share in case anyone else needed something similar.

##Installation with CocoaPods
CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Objective-C and Swift, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries in your projects. It's the preferred method of installing TFSliderView as it takes care of the POP integration as well.

####Podfile
```ruby
platform :ios, '8.0'
pod "TFSliderView", "~> 0.1.0"
```
